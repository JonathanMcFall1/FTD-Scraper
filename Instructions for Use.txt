FTD Scraper v3
Used to scrape FTD data for any ticker dating back to 2004 (All publicly available FTD data taken from www.SEC.gov)


Pre-requisites:
1. Python 3.6 or greater (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
2. Pandas module (After downloading Python, open command prompt and type "pip3 install pandas")

Using the scraper:
1. Open the text file 'tickerList.txt' and type the list of tickers you want the FTD data for separated by ", " (There should be an example when you open it for the first time)
2. Save the text file
3. Run 'FTD Scraper v3.py'
4. Let it work, there's hundreds of thousands of lines of text to work through. Usually takes about 20 seconds per ticker.
5. The CSV's will output to the outputs folder

Keeping this scraper up to date:
 - The SEC releases FTD data on a bi-monthly basis offset by half a month. Ex. The second half of June's data will be released halfway through July.
 - You can download the latest file every half month and rename the text file to match the format found in the FTD data folder. (Format: 'YYYYMMx'    x is either a or b depending on first(a) or second(b) half of month)
 - Once you have the text file downloaded and renamed, throw it in the FTD data folder, and if you sort by name it should be at the bottom.
